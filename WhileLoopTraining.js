/*
Task
Complete function padIt, which accepts 2 parameters:

str: a string representing the string to pad. We will pad it with "*" symbols on its left side and on its right side.
n: a number indicating how many times to pad the string.
Behaviour
You need to write a loop statement within the function that loops n times. Each time through the loop it will add one * to str, alternating on which side it is padded: the first time will add a * to the left side of str, the second time will add a * to the right side, and so on.

Finally, return the padded string.

function padIt(str,n){
  let num = 0
  
  while(num<n){
  str = '*' + str
  num++
  if(num === n){
   break
  } 
  str = str + '*'
  num++
  }
  return str
  }
